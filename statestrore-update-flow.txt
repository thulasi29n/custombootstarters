Creating a visual topology diagram here is limited by the textual format, but I can provide a textual representation for you. For a visual diagram, you'd typically use a tool or software like Visio, draw.io, Lucidchart, etc. 

Here's the textual representation:

```
[Original Topic]
       |
       | (Consumed by)
       v
[Enrichment Processor] -- External Data Lookup --> [Data Source for New Field]
       |
       | (Produces to)
       v
[Enriched Topic]
       |
       | (Consumed by)
       v
[Kafka Streams Application] -- Hydrates/Updates --> [State Store]
       |
       | (Optionally produces to other topics or services)
       v
[Other Topics/Services]
```

**Description**:

- **Original Topic**: Contains your original records.
  
- **Enrichment Processor**: This could be a separate Kafka Streams application, a Kafka producer, or another service that reads from the Original Topic, enriches the records by adding the new field, and then produces the enriched records to the `Enriched Topic`.
  
- **Data Source for New Field**: This is where the Enrichment Processor fetches the values for the new field. It could be a database, an API, a file, etc.
  
- **Enriched Topic**: Contains the records from the Original Topic, but with the added field.
  
- **Kafka Streams Application**: This is your main application that processes records from the `Enriched Topic`, handles the logic for the new field, and updates/hydrates its internal state store with the enriched data.
  
- **State Store**: The internal state store of the Kafka Streams application which gets updated/hydrated as the application processes the enriched records.
  
- **Other Topics/Services**: If your Kafka Streams application produces results to other topics or interfaces with other services, they are represented here.

For a more detailed and visual representation, I recommend using a visual diagramming tool, as mentioned earlier.
