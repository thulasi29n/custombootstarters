Apologies for the oversight. The hydration of the state store happens in step 4 when the Kafka Streams application processes the `enriched_topic` and updates its internal state. Here's a clearer breakdown:

1. Prepare the data for the new field.
2. Evolve the Avro schema and register it (if using Schema Registry).
3. Create an enrichment stream:
   - Consume from the original topic.
   - Enrich records with the new field.
   - Produce enriched records to a new topic (`enriched_topic`).
4. Modify Kafka Streams application:
   - Consume from `enriched_topic`.
   - Update processing logic for the new field.
5. Hydrate the state store:
   - As the modified Kafka Streams application processes the `enriched_topic`, it will update (or hydrate) its internal state store with the enriched data.
6. (Optional) Ensure application handles a mix of old and new records.
7. Transition:
   - Stop the old Kafka Streams app (if necessary).
   - Start the new Kafka Streams app.
   - Switch consumers to use the updated state store.
8. Test the process in a staging environment.
9. Monitor the new Kafka Streams application and state store.
10. (Optional) Clean up old records or compact the original topic.

Again, during this process, the state store gets updated as the new Kafka Streams application processes the enriched records from the `enriched_topic`.
